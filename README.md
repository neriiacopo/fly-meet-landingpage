# fly-meet-landingpage

Fly&meet is a research project that provides a platform to find affordable shared destinations among multiple origins. People from different places find the most comfortable destination for both parties. It applies to long-distance relationships 💘, your Erasmus friends 🎉, or your cousin that lives abroad 🍻. Through geospatial data visualizations, it makes complex decision-making easy!
